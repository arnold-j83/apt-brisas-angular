                <p>La Finca Golf is near Algorfa, Alicante on the Costa Blanca. The course opened in August 2002 and has become a firm favourite with regular visitors to the area. It is a par 72, 18 hole course designed by Pepe Gancedo, the course offers wide fairways on most holes but it is quite long at 6,032 meters off the yellow tees.The lakes and streams make for some interesting shots into the greens an example of which is the par 5 5th hole where you need to be up close for your approach shot because the green is totally surrounded by water. The following par 3 6th hole is 160 metres off the yellow tee across water all the way. The greens range from a very narrow 3rd hole where the green is just 4 metres wide to an enormous square green on the 7th hole, they are usually cut medium to fast. This is a must play course if you are visiting the Costa Blanca</p>
