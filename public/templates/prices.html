            <h3>Car Hire</h3>
            <p>One of the websites we recommend to use is <a href="http://www.skyscanner.net">www.skyscanner.net</a> but remember not always the cheapest is the best.</p>

            <p>Please remember on 8 June 2015, the paper counterpart to the photocard driving licence was abolished. The counterpart contained information such as any penalty points you have. Similarly, old-style paper licences, issued until 1998, are still valid but they won’t be updated with penalty points. Instead, you can now view all your up-to-date driving licence information using DVLA's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/view-driving-licence">View Driving Licence service</a>.</p>

            <h3>Keeping cool in summer</h3>
            <p>Spanish architects and builders are no strangers to the hot summer sun. The apartment is designed with cavity walls and lots of windows each with fully fitting roller shutters. Even at the hottest times the apartment will stay cool with natural ventilation through windows and doors and use of the ceiling fan. During the day the rooms will remain comfortably cool with the shutters down. It is at night, when the structure gives off heat that has built up during the day that you may feel the heat.</p>
            <h3>Keeping warm in winter</h3>
            <p>The Spanish Mediterranean coast is generally warm and sunny even in winter. However though the days are warm and sunny the night can get quite chilly. The apartment is equipped with two heaters that will quickly warm the rooms as required.</p>
